# EV Points Platform - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation enables a complete flow for EV drivers to earn on-chain points and sell them to Web3 users through proper SPL token delegation.

## Architecture

### PDAs (Program Derived Addresses)
1. **Platform State**: `seeds=[b"platform"]`
2. **Platform Authority**: `seeds=[b"platform_authority"]` - Delegates token transfers from drivers to buyers
3. **Mint Authority**: `seeds=[b"mint_authority"]` - Controls minting of new point tokens
4. **Driver Account**: `seeds=[b"driver", driver_pubkey]` - Stores driver data per user

## Instructions

### 1. `initialize_platform`
- Initializes the platform state with admin and fee configuration
- Creates the mint with PDA-controlled mint authority
- Sets up the foundation for the entire system

**Accounts:**
- `platform_state`: Platform configuration (PDA)
- `mint_authority`: PDA that controls minting (PDA)
- `mint`: The SPL token mint for points
- `admin`: Platform administrator

### 2. `register_driver`
- Registers a new EV driver in the system
- Initializes their account with pricing and stats
- Sets `active` status to `true` by default

**Accounts:**
- `driver_account`: Driver's account (PDA)
- `driver`: The driver's wallet (signer)

**Parameters:**
- `price_per_point`: Driver's pricing for selling points

### 3. `approve_platform_access` ‚ú® NEW
- **Uses SPL Token `approve` delegation**
- Driver delegates control of their tokens to the platform authority PDA
- Enables/disables selling without driver signature on each transaction
- Updates driver's `active` status

**Accounts:**
- `driver_account`: Driver's account (PDA)
- `platform_state`: Platform configuration
- `platform_authority`: PDA that receives delegation
- `driver_token_account`: Driver's token account
- `driver`: The driver (signer)

**Parameters:**
- `active`: Enable (true) or disable (false) selling
- `delegate_amount`: Number of tokens to delegate to platform

**Flow:**
- If `active = true`: Calls `token::approve()` to delegate authority to platform_authority PDA
- If `active = false`: Calls `token::revoke()` to remove delegation

### 4. `record_session`
- Records a charging session for a driver
- **Mints new point tokens** to the driver using mint_authority PDA
- Updates driver statistics
- Emits SessionRecorded event for transparency

**Accounts:**
- `platform_state`: Platform configuration (PDA)
- `driver_account`: Driver's account (PDA)
- `session`: New charging session account
- `driver`: The driver (signer)
- `mint_authority`: PDA with minting authority
- `mint`: The token mint
- `driver_token_account`: Driver's token account

**Parameters:**
- `charger_code`: Identifier for the charging station
- `energy_used`: Energy consumed in session (e.g., kWh)

**Calculation:**
- `points = energy_used / 10`

### 5. `buy_points` ‚ú® UPDATED
- **Uses delegated authority** from platform_authority PDA
- Enables Web3 users to buy points directly from active drivers
- Verifies driver has approved platform access
- Transfers SOL to driver, transfers points to buyer

**Accounts:**
- `buyer`: Web3 user buying points (signer)
- `driver_account`: Driver selling points (PDA, must be `active`)
- `platform_state`: Platform configuration
- `platform_authority`: PDA with delegated token authority
- `driver`: Driver receiving SOL payment
- `driver_token_account`: Source of points (must have delegation to platform_authority)
- `buyer_token_account`: Destination for points

**Parameters:**
- `amount`: Number of point tokens to transfer
- `sol_payment`: Amount of SOL to pay driver

**Security Checks:**
- ‚úÖ Driver must be `active`
- ‚úÖ Driver token account must have delegated to platform_authority
- ‚úÖ Uses PDA signer seeds for secure transfer

## Key Features

### üîê Security Through Delegation
- Drivers explicitly approve selling by delegating tokens to platform_authority PDA
- Platform can only transfer up to the delegated amount
- Drivers can revoke at any time by calling `approve_platform_access(active: false)`

### üéØ On-Chain Transparency
- All charging sessions recorded on-chain
- SessionRecorded events for live feed
- Immutable transaction history

### üí∞ Direct P2P Trading
- Buyers pay drivers directly in SOL
- No intermediary holding funds
- Platform uses delegation for trustless transfers

### ‚ö° Per-Watt Rewards
- Points calculated based on energy used
- Transparent 10:1 ratio (10 kWh = 1 point)
- Can be adjusted per driver via `price_per_point`

## Usage Flow

### For EV Drivers:
1. Call `register_driver` to create account
2. Charge vehicle ‚Üí platform calls `record_session` ‚Üí receive minted points
3. Call `approve_platform_access(true, amount)` to enable selling
4. Wait for buyers to purchase points
5. Receive SOL payments automatically
6. Call `approve_platform_access(false, 0)` to stop selling

### For Web3 Users:
1. Find active drivers with points available
2. Call `buy_points` with desired amount and payment
3. SOL transferred to driver
4. Points transferred to buyer's token account
5. Can resell or use points in ecosystem

## Error Handling

### Custom Errors (buy_points)
- `DriverNotActive`: Driver hasn't approved platform access
- `NoDelegation`: Driver token account doesn't have platform delegation
- `InvalidPlatformAuthority`: Platform authority PDA mismatch

## Technical Notes

### Token Delegation Benefits
- ‚úÖ Drivers maintain custody (no escrow needed)
- ‚úÖ Instant revocation capability
- ‚úÖ Standard SPL token pattern
- ‚úÖ Compatible with wallets and explorers

### PDA Strategy
- Separate PDAs for different authorities (mint vs transfer)
- Predictable addresses for client integration
- Secure signing without private keys

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements:
1. Add price discovery mechanism (orderbook or AMM)
2. Implement platform fees using `fee_bps` field
3. Add driver reputation/verification system
4. Create frontend marketplace UI
5. Add batch buying from multiple drivers
6. Implement time-based delegation expiry

### Integration Points:
- Frontend can query active drivers via `getProgramAccounts`
- Filter by `active = true` for available sellers
- Check delegation amount via token account data
- Monitor SessionRecorded events for live feed
